-- This Notebook is for Learning Joins in SQL
-- Types of Join
-- 1. Inner Join
-- 2. Left Join
-- 3. Right Join
-- 4. Full Join
-- 5. Self Join
-- 6. Cross Join (Cartesian Product)


-- Cross Join: It returns all possible combinations of rows from the two tables. This join is basically used when there is no column having same name in the joining tables otherwise it becomes inner join.
SELECT * FROM customers
CROSS JOIN orders;

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES
('John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com'),
('Emily Smith', 'emily.smith@example.com'),
('Michael Brown', 'michael.brown@example.com'),
('Sarah Taylor', 'sarah.taylor@example.com');

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, total) VALUES
(1, '2023-01-01', 100.00),
(1, '2023-01-15', 50.00),
(2, '2023-02-01', 200.00),
(3, '2023-03-01', 75.00),
(4, '2023-04-01', 150.00);

-- Inner Join
SELECT * FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Right Join
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Left Join
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Full Outer Join
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
UNION
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- SELF Join
SELECT * FROM customers AS t1
INNER JOIN customers AS t2
ON t1.id; -- This is like full self join

SELECT * FROM customers AS t1
INNER JOIN customers AS t2
ON t1.id = t2.id;

-- Practice Questions
-- Query 1: Join multiple tables
SELECT * 
FROM FLIPCART.USERS AS USERS
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDERS AS ORDERS
ON USERS.USER_ID = ORDERS.USER_ID
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDER_DETAILS AS ORDER_DETAILS
ON ORDER_DETAILS.ORDER_ID = ORDERS.ORDER_ID
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.CATEGORY AS CATEGORY
ON CATEGORY.CATEGORY_ID = ORDER_DETAILS.CATEGORY_ID;

-- Query 2: Find all orders placed in Pune
SELECT * FROM FLIPCART.USERS AS USERS
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDERS AS ORDERS
ON USERS.USER_ID = ORDERS.USER_ID
WHERE USERS.CITY = 'PUNE';

-- Query 3: Find all profitable orders
SELECT ORDERS.ORDER_ID, SUM(OD.AMOUNT) AS PROFIT FROM FLIPCART.USERS AS USERS
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDERS AS ORDERS
ON USERS.USER_ID = ORDERS.USER_ID
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDER_DETAILS AS OD
ON OD.ORDER_ID = ORDERS.ORDER_ID
GROUP BY ORDERS.ORDER_ID
HAVING SUM(OD.AMOUNT) > 0;

-- Query 4: Find the name of the customer who has placed the maximum number of orders
SELECT USERS.NAME, COUNT(USERS.CITY) AS CT FROM FLIPCART.USERS AS USERS
INNER JOIN FLIPCART.ORDERS AS ORDERS
ON USERS.USER_ID = ORDERS.USER_ID
GROUP BY USERS.USER_ID, USERS.NAME
ORDER BY CT DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- SET Operations
-- 1. UNION
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
UNION
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- 2. UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- 3. INTERSECTION 
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- 4. EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
